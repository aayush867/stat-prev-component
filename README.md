## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot writing this project.Every Programmer learns the basic syntax and methods of writing code from tutorials.However there are some small things that we can only learn by creating actual projects and making mistakes.
In this project i learned how to better use the grid css by learning about grid-row property.
Also i learned how to play around with images and blend them with colours using overlay.
Also i got stuck while making the design responsive,but learned a lot of cool tricks in the process


### Continued development
I want to continue improving my layout skills.Also i am not very  good at making the page responsive.So I have to continue working on that too.


### Useful resources

- [Css Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me in getting some concepts of css crystal clear. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an info-loaded site,with lots of examples and useful for getting complete info about any html tag or Css Property . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
